Problems are code base errors captured by the Treblle SDK. When Treblle captures an error we will show it in the problems tab of a project

Treblle captures both codebase errors and non-codebase errors for example, Treblle can check misspelling that might cause problems in your API [documentations](/platform/api-documentation/).

When Treblle notice something that is not normal for like you were having an average load time of **50ms** and after a while you start getting a load time of **500ms**, Treblle will create a new problem in the problems tab to let you know of this change.

You can see at a glance the following information about a problem:

- The HTTP method of the problem (if applicable)
- The problem [severity](#problem-severity) level
- The number of occurrences of that problem in your project
- The status of the problem - closed or open

## Problem severity

A problem in Treblle can have one of the following severity:

- Low
- Medium
- High

## Close a problem

If you want to close a problem in the **Problems** tab, click on the dropdown menu in the top-right corner of the problem and click on **Mark as closed**. A confirmation modal will appear for you to click on **Confirm** if you want to proceed.

## Filters

You can filter the endpoints in the **Problems** tab of a project by clicking on the **Filter** button to access the filters drawer for endpoints.

In the filters drawer, you filter endpoints by:

- Is resolved: either, yes or no
- HTTP method
- Group
- [Endpoint](/platform/endpoints/)
- Severity

Click on the **Filter** button to apply the filters you selected.
