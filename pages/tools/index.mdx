import { fetchGlobalProps } from "../../features/GlobalProps/lib/fetchGlobalProps";


export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {

      return {
          props: {
              ...(await fetchGlobalProps()),
          },
      };

}


As well as our core product, Treblle, we have built a few tools that help developers and API providers.

## Aspen

Aspen is a free API-testing native app for macOS. Built with ZERO trust in mind, there is no login required to run API test. It is specifically made to meet the needs of testing REST APIs, and with the help of AI, instantly help with integrations by generating data models, Open API Specifications and generating integration code.

## API Insights

API Insights analyzes your API specification and provides a score based on industry-standard design, security, and performance best practices.

Use the score and feedback to improve the quality of your APIs. Ensure your APIs are secure and performant. Share with colleagues to reinforce standards and promote API governance.

Works with any OpenAPI Specification v3.x in JSON format.

## Treblle CLI

The Treblle CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with the Treblle API. It is a simple tool that allows you to perform various operations on your API. Currently, it supports the following operations:

- Run API Insights tests against your OpenAPI Specification.
