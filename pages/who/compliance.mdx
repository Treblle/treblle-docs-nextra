As a member of the compliance team, you bear the crucial responsibility of ensuring your organization’s APIs adhere to relevant regulations and standards. The challenge of detecting and responding to potential issues without proper observability and monitoring is often likened to finding a needle in a haystack. When you lack visibility into API behavior, performance, and health, numerous hurdles can arise.

Spotting potential compliance issues becomes a significant challenge, with non-compliant activities potentially slipping through the cracks. Investigating incidents can be incredibly arduous, severely affecting efficiency. Moreover, when auditors request insights, gathering the necessary information can be a tall order.
