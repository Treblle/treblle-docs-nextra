## Roles

Each invited user can be given a Workspace Role. This role determines what actions they can perform in the workspace.

- **Owner**: A Workspace Owner can manage all People, Settings, and APIs in the Workspace. Workspace Owners will see all APIs regardless of Visibility and will have Workspace Analytics for all APIs in the Workspace. There can be multiple Owners in a Workspace.
- **Member**: A Workspace Member will have limited access. They will see only APIs that they have been invited to. A Member can only access Docs for APIs `public` APIs that they are not a Member of.

## Members

Below the invite field, there is a list of all of the existing members of your Workspaces, with their role and a hamburger dropdown with additional options.
This is where a Workspace Owner can delete or remove a user from the workspace.

There is also a table to show all of the pending invitations along with the option to resend the invitation email.
